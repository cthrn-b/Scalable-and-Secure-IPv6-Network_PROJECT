# PROJECT: Scalable and Secure IPv6 Network

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **scalable and secure IPv6 network**, incorporating advanced **routing protocols (OSPFv3, BGP)**, wireless networking, and security measures.

## Objectives
- Implement an **IPv6-based network** for a mid-sized organization transitioning from IPv4.
- Deploy **advanced routing protocols** (OSPFv3, BGP) for efficient traffic management.
- Integrate **wireless technologies** (Wi-Fi 6, mesh networks) with security mechanisms.
- Apply **SQL data analysis** for network performance evaluation.
- Conduct **comprehensive testing** to verify connectivity, routing, and security.

## Project Phases
### 1. Design Phase
- **IPv6 Address Plan**: Efficient subnetting and addressing scheme.
- **Routing Protocol Selection**: Justification for using OSPFv3, BGP, or both.
- **Wireless Network Design**: Secure and scalable wireless architecture (WPA3, mesh networks).
- **Network Security Considerations**: Firewall policies, VPN, and encryption.

### 2. Implementation Phase
- **IPv6 Configuration**: Assigning and configuring addresses on routers, switches, and access points.
- **Routing Protocol Deployment**: Implementing OSPFv3/BGP for optimized data flow.
- **Wireless Network Setup**: Configuring wireless APs with proper security measures.
- **Security Measures**: Firewall rules, access control lists (ACLs), and encrypted communication.

### 3. Testing Phase
- **Connectivity Testing**: Using **ping, traceroute**, and other diagnostic tools.
- **Routing Protocol Verification**: Ensuring dynamic route propagation.
- **Wireless Network Performance**: Measuring signal strength, throughput, and security features.
